This project features an engaging and educational interactive map that provides insights into the background, origins, and distinctive characteristics of various hominins. Users can explore this information by hovering over different pins on the map, each representing a unique hominins species.

In addition to the interactive map, the project includes a fun and informative puzzle game. Users have the freedom to select any hominins species featured on the map to use in the puzzle. This game not only provides entertainment but also reinforces the learning objectives by encouraging users to remember and recognize the characteristics of various hominins.
